# PAPST: Peak Assignment and Profile Search Tool

A tool for Chip-seq analysis.

## Post Peak-calling Analysis

PAPST is a user friendly program for analysis of ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) experiments.   

## Features
The main features of PAPST are:
* Transcription Factor (TF) and Epigenetic Mark (EM) profile pattern search
* Assignment of ChIP-seq peaks of known genes.
* Analysis of peak binding distribution (% promoter, % gene body, etc.)
* Calculate shared/overlapping peaks between multiple ChIP-seq experiments
* Genome agnostic analysis, supports all genomes available through UCSC Genome Browser
* Quickly and interactively analyze ChIP-Seq peaks from multiple experiments
